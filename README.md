Code samples and modifications from Core Java for the Impatient

[Web Site](http://horstmann.com/javaimpatient/)

## Layout

The original code examples are in teh `/code` subdirectory. I cannot find an explicit license for these, but they DO NOT inherit the license of my own code as listed in `LICENSE.md`.

`/matt_code` are my own notes/modifications/playing with java code examples and exercises.
